# A Guide to Service Worker: The Service Worker Lifecycle
***





This can lead to surprises. For example, the first time a page with a service worker loads, you'll register the service worker, and then you might attempt to get permissions to provide push notifications, which we'll assume the user grants.


    // Simplest possible illustration of registering and looking for push permissions
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js', {scope: '/'})
    .then() //FINISH THIS


At this point you have a service worker registration, an active service worker (assuming this was a brand new worker, and not replacing another worker at the same scope), and a push subscription. However, push notifications will not work yet. This is because the page is not *controlled* by the worker yet. A service worker only becomes a controller on navigation. This means that you'll need at least a page refresh before your notifications start to workâ€”if you have other pages open to the scope you'll need to close them first. You can check whether the page is controlled by a service worker by seeing whether `navigator.serviceWorker.controller` is defined.

    

[why should this fail if there doesn't even need to be a controlled page? somehow the worker has a status that is tied to having once been a controller of a page? what if the page had been closed?]
