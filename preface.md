# A Guide to Service Worker: Preface

***

When I started implementing caching and notifications for [Sandglaz](https://www.sandglaz.com/), there were not a lot of resources. There were a handful of relevant articles at places like [HTML5Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/), and [a bunch of samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/samples/tree/gh-pages/service-worker) on GitHub, but I eventually found myself reading specifications to get a better of understanding of how exactly everything fit together. So I thought, if no one else has written a book on this yet, why not me? Then I thought of several excellent reasons why not me. Then I brushed them off and created the repository for this book. I am hopeful that I will get far enough with it for it to be helpful to others.
